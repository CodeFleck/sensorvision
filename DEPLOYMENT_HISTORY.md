## Deployment Procedures

### Automated CI/CD Pipeline

All production deployments are automated via GitHub Actions when code merges to `main`.

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`

**Pipeline Steps**:
1. **Build Phase**
   - Checkout code
   - Build Docker image
   - Push to Amazon ECR
   - Security scan with Trivy

2. **Deploy Phase**
   - SSH to EC2 instance
   - Copy deployment files
   - Create environment configuration
   - Run deployment script
   - Verify application health

### Manual Deployment (Emergency)

If automated deployment fails:

```bash
# 1. SSH to production server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key ec2-user@35.88.65.186

# 2. Navigate to application directory
cd /home/ec2-user/sensorvision

# 3. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 4. Run deployment script
./deploy.sh

# 5. Verify deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

### Windows Deployment Scripts

**PowerShell Script** (Recommended):
```powershell
.\deploy-production.ps1 -SSHKeyPath "C:\path\to\key.pem"
```

**Batch File**:
```batch
deploy-production.bat "C:\path\to\key.pem"
```

---

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment causes issues:

```bash
# 1. SSH to production server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key ec2-user@35.88.65.186

# 2. Navigate to application directory
cd /home/ec2-user/sensorvision

# 3. Checkout previous stable commit
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# 4. Redeploy
./deploy.sh

# 5. Verify
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Health Checks
- **Application**: http://35.88.65.186:8080/actuator/health
- **Liveness**: http://35.88.65.186:8080/actuator/health/liveness
- **Readiness**: http://35.88.65.186:8080/actuator/health/readiness

### Log Access
```bash
# Backend logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f backend

# PostgreSQL logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f postgres

# MQTT logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f mosquitto

# All services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f
```

### Common Issues

#### SSH Permission Denied
```powershell
# Fix PEM file permissions (Windows)
icacls "C:\path\to\key.pem" /inheritance:r
icacls "C:\path\to\key.pem" /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(R)"
```

#### Health Check Timeout
```bash
# SSH into server and check logs
ssh -i "C:\path\to\key.pem" ec2-user@35.88.65.186
cd /home/ec2-user/sensorvision
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs backend --tail=100

# Restart backend if needed
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml restart backend
```

#### Port Not Accessible
Ensure these ports are open in EC2 security group:
- 22 (SSH)
- 8080 (Backend API)
- 3000 (Frontend)
- 9090 (Prometheus)
- 3001 (Grafana)

### Resource Monitoring
```bash
# Container stats
docker stats

# Disk usage
docker system df

# Server resources
top
free -h
df -h
```
