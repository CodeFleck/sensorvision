## Deployment Process

### Automated CI/CD Pipeline
All deployments to production are handled automatically via GitHub Actions when code is merged to the `main` branch.

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`

**Steps**:
1. **Build Phase**
   - Checkout code
   - Build Docker image
   - Push to Amazon ECR
   - Security scan with Trivy

2. **Deploy Phase**
   - SSH to EC2 instance
   - Copy deployment files
   - Create environment configuration
   - Run deployment script
   - Verify application health

### Manual Deployment (if needed)
```bash
# 1. SSH to production server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key ec2-user@35.88.65.186

# 2. Navigate to application directory
cd /home/ec2-user/sensorvision

# 3. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 4. Run deployment script
./deploy.sh

# 5. Verify deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

## Rollback Procedure

If a deployment fails or causes issues:

```bash
# 1. SSH to production server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key ec2-user@35.88.65.186

# 2. Navigate to application directory
cd /home/ec2-user/sensorvision

# 3. Checkout previous stable commit
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# 4. Redeploy
./deploy.sh

# 5. Verify
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

## Monitoring

### Health Checks
- **Application**: http://35.88.65.186:8080/actuator/health
- **Liveness**: http://35.88.65.186:8080/actuator/health/liveness
- **Readiness**: http://35.88.65.186:8080/actuator/health/readiness

### Logs
```bash
# Backend logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f backend

# PostgreSQL logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f postgres

# MQTT logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f mosquitto

# All services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f
```

## Known Issues

None currently. All systems operational.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Set up automated performance testing after deployments
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- [ ] Add production metrics dashboard
- [ ] Configure automated backups for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical failures
