## Deployment Log

### 2025-10-26 - Integration Wizard Connection Test Fix

**Type:** Bug Fix
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed Successfully
**Deployment Method:** GitHub Actions CI/CD
**Deployment Time:** 4m 5s
**Git Commit:** `5cd273ce`

**Issue:**
- Integration Wizard connection test was failing with error: "Unsupported data type for field 'test': Boolean (expected number or numeric string)"
- The test connection function was sending `test: true` in the payload, but SensorVision backend only accepts numeric values for telemetry variables

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed the boolean `test: true` field from the connection test payload in `frontend/src/pages/IntegrationWizard.tsx:575`
- Connection test now only sends numeric values: `temperature: 23.5` and `humidity: 65.2`

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/IntegrationWizard.tsx` (1 deletion)

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Built frontend with fix: `npm run build` (completed in 4.02s)
2. Committed changes to branch `fix/clipboard-copy-integration-wizard`
3. Pushed to remote repository
4. Merged PR #17 to main branch
5. GitHub Actions workflow triggered automatically
6. Docker image built and pushed to ECR (2m 38s)
7. Deployed to EC2 instance at 35.88.65.186
8. Health check verified: Backend UP, Frontend Online

**Verification:**
- Backend health: http://35.88.65.186:8080/actuator/health (Status: UP ‚úÖ)
- Frontend: http://35.88.65.186:3000/ (Status: Online ‚úÖ)
- Integration Wizard: http://35.88.65.186:3000/integration-wizard (Status: Online ‚úÖ)

**Impact:**
- Users can now successfully test device connections in Integration Wizard
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible

## Error Tracking & Automatic Ticket Creation

When deployment errors occur, tickets are automatically created in GitHub Issues with the following information:

**Automatic Ticket Template:**
- **Title:** `[DEPLOYMENT ERROR] - [Date] - [Brief Description]`
- **Labels:** `deployment-error`, `bug`, `needs-investigation`
- **Priority:** Based on error severity
- **Content:**
  - Error message and stack trace
  - Deployment step that failed
  - Environment information
  - Relevant logs
  - Suggested remediation steps

**Manual Ticket Creation:**
If automatic creation fails, use the following command:
```bash
gh issue create --title "[DEPLOYMENT ERROR] - Description" \
  --label "deployment-error,bug,needs-investigation" \
  --body "Error details here"
```

## Deployment Best Practices

1. **Always use feature branches** - Never commit directly to main
2. **Test locally first** - Run `npm run build` and verify no errors
3. **Monitor the deployment** - Use `gh run watch` to track GitHub Actions
4. **Verify health checks** - Check backend `/actuator/health` endpoint
5. **Document everything** - Update this file immediately after deployment
6. **Have a rollback plan** - Know how to revert if issues arise

## Quick Reference

### Common Deployment Commands

```bash
# Build frontend locally
cd frontend && npm run build

# Check git status
git status

# Commit changes
git add <files>
git commit -m "type: description"

# Push to remote
git push origin <branch-name>

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"

# Merge PR (auto-deploy to production)
gh pr merge <PR-number> --squash --delete-branch

# Monitor deployment
gh run watch <run-id>

# Check production health
curl http://35.88.65.186:8080/actuator/health

# Create issue for error
gh issue create --title "[ERROR] Description" --label "bug" --body "Details"
```

### Environment Information

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Identify the last working commit
git log --oneline -10

# 2. Create rollback branch from working commit
git checkout -b rollback/<issue-description> <working-commit-sha>

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin rollback/<issue-description>
gh pr create --title "Rollback: <reason>" --body "Rolling back to commit <sha>"

# 4. Merge to trigger deployment
gh pr merge --squash
```

### Emergency Rollback (EC2 Direct)
```bash
# SSH into EC2 and redeploy previous image
ssh -i ~/.ssh/key.pem ec2-user@35.88.65.186
cd /home/ec2-user/sensorvision
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```
