- Greenshot

### Image Optimization

Before adding to documentation:
1. Crop to relevant area (remove unnecessary white space)
2. Optimize file size (use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh)
3. Add subtle borders if helpful: `border: 1px solid #ccc`
4. Consider adding annotations (arrows, highlights) for complex screenshots

---

## Adding Screenshots to Documentation

### Option 1: Local Images (Recommended for GitHub)

1. Create images directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/images
   ```

2. Save screenshots in `docs/images/` folder

3. Update `SENSOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` by replacing placeholder text:
   ```markdown
   ![Device Management Page](docs/images/01-device-management-page.png)
   ```

### Option 2: Inline in Markdown

For GitHub README or markdown viewers that support it:
```markdown
![Device Management Page](docs/images/01-device-management-page.png)
*Caption: The Device Management page displays all registered IoT devices*
```

## Testing the Documentation

After adding screenshots:

1. View the documentation in a markdown viewer or GitHub
2. Verify all images load correctly
3. Check that images are properly sized and readable
4. Ensure captions/descriptions match the images
5. Test on mobile view (if documentation will be viewed on mobile)

---

## Quick Start Script

To quickly start the app with sample data for screenshots:

```bash
# Run this script from the project root
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting SensorVision for screenshot capture..."

# Start Docker services
echo "1. Starting Docker services..."
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for services to be ready
echo "2. Waiting for services to initialize..."
sleep 5

# Start backend with simulator
echo "3. Starting backend (this will run in foreground)..."
echo "   Press Ctrl+C when done capturing screenshots"
echo "   Then start frontend in another terminal with: cd frontend && npm run dev"

# Start backend
./gradlew bootRun
```

Save as `start-for-screenshots.sh` and make executable: `chmod +x start-for-screenshots.sh`

---

## Notes

- Take screenshots in a clean state (no browser extensions visible, no personal data)
- Use consistent browser zoom level (100%)
- Capture during daytime or use light theme for clarity
- Ensure sample data is realistic and representative
- Consider annotating screenshots for clarity (arrows, highlights, labels)
